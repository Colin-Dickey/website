    <h1>Getting into CFD!</h1>
    <p>If you're considering employing me or found this page exploring, this should be a sort of blog exploring my interest in CFD with OpenFoam. I'm also very excited to be beginning my usage of CAD software, using FreeCAD because open source rules:).</p>
    <p>I'm certainly still in the process of developing my Eulerian and Lagrangian fluid simulator, however I think I want to retry them with OpenGL because I would like them to be 3D at some point and I think OpenGL is better for this.</p>

    <p>I've just graduated recently from UoM, and my last semester had a great module "Physics of Fluids" that I got really into. It was mostly analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and applying some boundary conditions. The module had loads of
        interesting fluid dynamics phenomena like ripples in water flow when it runs down a hill that answered some of those questions I had when I was much younger walking to school. Now that I've graduated, I can definitely see myself entering the CFD space
        and who knows maybe one day I'll suddenly find myself doing CFD simulations for hydropower (dream job).
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm trying to learn how to use OpenFoam, FreeCad and Paraview one, because I want to use them in the future and two, because I'm trying to 3D print a turbine rotor and then use it to drive a washing machine motor to generate power. I want to simulate
        the rotor first however and try and generate some expected values of power and then use a multi-meter to see how far off I was. I'm doing this alongside a recent engineering graduate "Steven Hargy" who's helping with the CAD but hopefully soon, I won't
        need the help. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I try use these softwares I'll also be going through some CFD university notes <a href ="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/wp-content/uploads/2017/ams260/svn/_build/html/_downloads/ams260.pdf">Prof. Dongwook Lee's CFD Notes.</a> I done some
        sort of assessment for a CFD job today and it went awful, maybe shouldn't have wung it but it was a learning experience so whatever.

        Turns out CAD modelling isn't the easiest thing ever. At the moment I've got a aerofoil created, I'm going to try copy paste it onto a central cylinder 3-4 times and add a nose cone then try create a mesh of this rotor.

        Turned the fin into a mesh, it looks really cool. FreeCAD seems to have some in-built FEM analysis so I'm going to try use some of it before doing the full model to see what happens.
