    <h1>Lagrangian Fluid Simulation</h1>
    <p>As I understand it, a lagrangian fluid simulation is one in which the fluid is simulated using many particles that detect collisions
        and interactions with one another as opposed to a eulerian fluid simulation that uses a grid and produces a velocity field of the fluid.
        This definitely feels like the easier of the two, I think the goal would be to get as many particles on the screen in real time as possible.
