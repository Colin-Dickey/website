    <h1>Decay Project</h1>
    <p>Context of data collection was 10-6 moles of Sr-79 decaying into Rb-79, then photons detected from the beta plus decay of the Rb-79.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <img src="images/Code-Assignment.png" width="600" height="600">
    <p>Comparing to known values of decay constant,  Rb-79=0.5ms-1 and Sr-79=5ms-1, spot on.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Process: Values</h2>
    <p>Without considering uncertainties, first we derive the activity of Rb-79 with some differential equation substitutions.</p>
    <img src="images/Rb-Activity.png" width="448" height="38">
    <p>This is going to create the red model curve seen previously, and to then create the line of best fit, we can use a least squares method with a few iterations to obtain the best values for the decay constants for Rb-79 and Sr-79, by minimising chi^2. Quite simple, uncertainties are a bit more involved.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Process: Uncertainties</h2>
    <p>Uncertainties calculated with contour plot.</p>
    <p>To calculate the uncertainties associated with these values, we'll vary the values of the decay constant slightly and with each variation, recalculate chi^2. If observed from the side this contour plot would be a valley.</p>
    <p>Using some nice relationships between chi^2 and the standard deviation of parameters, if we take the ellipse of constant chi^2+1, and calculate the difference from the top and bottom of the the ellipse, we'll get 1 standard deviation(uncertainty) of the parameter on the vertical axes. (Similary for the horizontal axes)
