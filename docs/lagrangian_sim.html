    <h1>
        Lagrangian Fluid Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>As I understand it, a lagrangian fluid simulation is one in which the fluid is simulated using many particles that detect collisions
        and interactions with one another as opposed to a eulerian fluid simulation that uses a grid and produces a velocity field of the fluid.
        This definitely feels like the easier of the two, I think the goal would be to get as many particles on the screen in real time as possible.

        We'll start with a 2D solution but will eventually upgrade to a 3D solution which is a trivial evolution.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Collision Detection
    </h2>
    <p>
        To calculate the collisions the simulator determines the distance between two points then checks if there is overlap. If there is the simulation
        then will compute the normalised vector between the two circles and then reassign their velocities as if it was a perfectly elastic collision.

        Least Optimised Viable Solution

    <p>
        This simulation works but is quite terrible, every particle is checking itself against every other particle in the simulation for collisions, when they
        may be on other sides of the screen to one another. To fix this we can employ a better method of tracking particles to reduce the number of calculations
        the simulation computes.

    <h2>
        Grid-Based Data Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
        The easiest would be a simple grid based structure that tracks the grid that each particle is in, only performing the collision check when a particle is
        in a neighbour grid.

    <p>
        We can see that given a sufficently small radius of circle, circle 7 can ignore the collision effects of 1-6 as they are not in neighbouring grids
        and therefore it is not possible to collide with them, we therefore do not have to compute the collision. This produces a pretty substantial performance
        increase. 40x the number of particles at roughly the same FPS, it may also be possible to optimise the grid size for the particle radius so perhaps
        I'll run an experiment and determine the optimal parameters for my collision detection.
