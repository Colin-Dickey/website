        Lagrangian Fluid Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>As I understand it, a lagrangian fluid simulation is one in which the fluid is simulated using many particles that detect collisions
        and interactions with one another as opposed to a eulerian fluid simulation that uses a grid and produces a velocity field of the fluid.
        This definitely feels like the easier of the two, I think the goal would be to get as many particles on the screen in real time as possible.

        We'll start with a 2D solution but will eventually upgrade to a 3D solution which is a trivial evolution.

        This simulation works but is quite terrible, every particle is checking itself against every other particle in the simulation, when they
        may be on other sides of the screen to one another.
