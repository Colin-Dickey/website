    <h1>C&I Initiative</h1>
    <h2>Early Days</h2>

    <p>
        This is all subject to change as this hopefully develops, but C&I Initiative is a service started by my friend and fellow UoM graduate Iolyn and I that hopes to even the playing field for students in
        secondary school. We believe that students are being held back from fully pursuing education due to many factors out of their control, one being the title image on the home screen, parental academic
        success is one of the biggest indicators of student academic success. Life is obviously unfair but hopefully this service could provide a face more relatable than a teacher's to a student who has an 
        unrealised potential in education.

        This <a href="C&I_Initiative.pptx" download>link</a> hopefully will download a powerpoint presentation on some of the motivations and goals.

        Currently, we're in conversation with two secondary schools in the Causeway Coast and Glens area, and hopefully can bring the service into schools in North Wales too.
